# Inconsistent useEffect Cleanup Function in React 19

This repository demonstrates a bug related to the `useEffect` hook's cleanup function in React 19.  In certain situations, the cleanup function is not consistently running before the next effect, potentially leading to memory leaks or other unexpected behavior.  The bug is reproduced and a solution is provided.

## Bug Description

The `useEffect` hook's cleanup function is designed to run before the next effect is executed. However, under certain conditions in React 19, this is not always the case. This inconsistency causes unexpected behavior, particularly when managing resources or side effects that require cleanup.

## Reproduction

The `bug.js` file contains a React component that illustrates the problem.  Observe the console logs to see that the cleanup function may not always run as expected.  This will depend on how you interact with the component and the underlying React reconciliation process.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows a solution or workaround to address the inconsistent cleanup function. The solution may involve refactoring the component to prevent unnecessary re-renders or managing the resources more effectively in the cleanup function.
